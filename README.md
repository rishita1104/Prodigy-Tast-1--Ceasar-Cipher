# Prodigy-Tast-1--Ceasar-Cipher
This is a basic Python project that lets you encrypt and decrypt messages using the Caesar Cipher technique. You can enter a message and a number (called a "shift"), and the program will shift each letter in the message to hide it. It also works the other way â€” you can decrypt messages if you know the shift value.
